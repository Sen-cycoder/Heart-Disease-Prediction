# Heart-Disease-Prediction


Heart disease dataset  will analyze, predict the result whether the patient has heart disease or normal, i.e. Heart disease prediction using Machine Learning. This prediction will make it faster and more efficient in healthcare sectors which will be a time-consuming process.

Key Takeaways
1. This process involves data cleaning, data statistics, getting insights from the dataset.
2. This involves four machine learning algorithms which will result in performance metrics of the model.
3. The well-doing algorithm is implemented in the model and checking results with the real-time data.






Here I will be experimenting with 3 algorithms of Machine Learning

(i)   KNeighborsClassifier

(ii)  DecisionTreeClassifier

(iii) RandomForestClassifier
